### About
- A dynamic yet predictable decentralized elastic supply token redesigned to solve market manipulation and appeal to all.
- BASEFI is an elastic supply cryptocurrency with a built-in 23 hour rebase mechanism. The supply of BASEFI tokens “BASEFI and reBASEFI,” adjusting to the supply and demand of the market. Think of reBASEFI as an automated Central Bank that expands and contracts the current supply, based on economic supply and demand factors.

### Rebase system
- 23 Hour Rebase
    + The Base Finance rebase system is designed to rebase itself every 23 hours. Some may ask why the 23 hour timeframe was implemented over the common 24 hour mechanism, or why not random? We discussed all of these ideas; however, we came to the conclusion that our method is the fairest way that will appeal to the most users. Our method ensures that investors in a certain time zone are not always receiving a rebase at 3 AM when part of the world is sleeping. This allows all parts of the world to rotate in experiencing a rebase in their peak hours. Thus, allowing a fair opportunity of trading and arbitrage for all time zones. Each day the rebase time in your time zone will be one hour earlier than the previous day. ie. Today’s distribution may be at 3 UTC, but tomorrow’s will be at 2 UTC, and so forth. We believe our 23 hour system gives exchanges and traders the predictability they need while also ensuring an equal opportunity no matter their geographical location.
- Plainness
    + We believe in being 100% transparent. This means with our code, with our distribution, and with our ideas. We actually think the predictability is necessary because it allows BASEFI to appeal to every single type of token holders: short term traders, long term traders, yield farmers, arbitrageurs, etc. BASEFI is built to appeal to the masses. A random rebase function alienates some of these DeFi users, arbitrageurs, and short term traders. Not to mention, also making it harder to use as DeFi collateral. For long term success this is not ideal; you need to appeal to every single type of investor. Part of what makes bitcoin valuable is its predictability. You can know what the max supply will be, and even closely calculate how many Bitcoin there will be on each day. BASEFI is built dynamic, fair, predictable, decentralized, and for all!
